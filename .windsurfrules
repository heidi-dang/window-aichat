# AUTOMOD PROTOCOL
When I initiate a task, you are to operate in "AutoMod" (Autonomous Engineering) mode:

1. PLAN: Before writing code, generate a PRD and a 'Todo' list in the Cascade panel. Wait for a quick 'thumbs up' before proceeding.
2. EXECUTE: Proactively edit multiple files, create new directories, and use the terminal to install dependencies.
3. VERIFY: Use the built-in browser preview or terminal test runners to verify your work.
4. ARCHITECTURE: Prioritize "First-of-its-kind" logic. If a solution is too standard, look for innovative alternatives using modern tech stacks (Next.js 15, etc.).

## MEMORY ALIGNMENT RULE
Before any edit, read MEMORY.md to ensure the change aligns with the core innovation of predictive code evolution and doesn't introduce 'generic' patterns that dilute the system's proactive intelligence capabilities.
