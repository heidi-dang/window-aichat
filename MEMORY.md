## Core Innovation: Predictive Code Evolution

**Window-AIChat's core innovation is predictive code evolution** - a revolutionary system that transforms the IDE from reactive to proactive by:

1. **Anticipating Code Changes**: Uses pattern recognition and AI models to predict what code modifications will be needed before developers even think of them
2. **Real-time Architectural Intelligence**: Continuously analyzes codebase health and suggests structural improvements
3. **Living Documentation**: Maintains perfectly synchronized documentation that evolves with the codebase automatically

## Innovation Alignment Rules

### ✅ ENHANCES Core Innovation:
- Features that make predictions more accurate or faster
- UI that surfaces predictive insights more intuitively  
- Systems that reduce the time between code change and documentation update
- Multi-agent orchestration that improves prediction quality
- Real-time collaborative prediction sharing

### ❌ DILUTES Core Innovation:
- Generic IDE features (file explorers, basic syntax highlighting)
- Static documentation systems
- Manual code review tools
- Traditional chat interfaces without predictive context
- Features that add latency to the prediction pipeline

## Decision Framework

Before implementing any feature, ask:
1. **Does this make the predictions smarter?**
2. **Does this reduce the time to insight?**
3. **Does this automate what was previously manual?**
4. **Does this maintain the real-time nature of the system?**

If the answer to all questions is "no", the feature dilutes the core innovation and should be reconsidered.

## Technical Non-Negotiables

- **<2s response time** for all predictive insights
- **Real-time sync** between code and documentation  
- **Proactive suggestions** not reactive analysis
- **Continuous learning** from user interactions
- **Scalable pattern recognition** across large codebases
