# Skill: UI-Refiner
**Description:** Ensures all UI components are polished, responsive, and follow project themes.

## Instructions
1. **Consistency:** Always check `tailwind.config.js` or global CSS for existing variables before styling.
2. **Edge Cases:** Automatically add Loading states, Error states, and Empty states for all new components.
3. **Responsiveness:** Verify the component looks correct on mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
4. **Accessibility:** Ensure proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation are included without being asked.
